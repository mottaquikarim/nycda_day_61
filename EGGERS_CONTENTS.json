{"home":{"content":"# Simple Routing\n\nWelcome to Lecture 61! Here is a brief class breakdown.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n1. Explore front-end routing with React/Flux\n\n## Game Plan\n\nHere's our game plan:\n\n### Final Projects\n\nYou should be working on final projects already. I will be looking at your github repos and I **expect** to see commits indicating progress.\n\nAlso - **reach out to me** with questions / for guidance. I've been doing a lot of outreach to people tryna get them to schedule meetings with me, I shouldn't have to work this hard for what is ultimately **your** responsibility. \n\n### Alarm Clock Implementation\n\nConsider **[this repo](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/nycda_react_starter/tree/lecture60/alarm)**. It is a fully working implementation of the alarm clock we discussed on Sunday. \n\nLook through the code and explain to your table **what** the code does + **how** it works. Feel free to add debug statements in the code to understand what it does. \n\n### Routing Implementation\n\nConsider **[this repo](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/nycda_react_starter/tree/lecture60/routes/alarm)**. It is a refactored implementation of the alarm clock app from above, but now with routes.\n\nLook through the code and explain to your table **what** the code does + **how** it works. Feel free to add debug statements in the code to understand what it does. \n\n### Add Edit/ route\n\nUpdate the code from above to include a new route: **/edit/:id** which will allow user to edit the time and name for an alarm. \n\n\n\n\n\n","idx":0},"__list__":["home"]}
